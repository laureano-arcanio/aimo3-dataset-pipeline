\section*{Problem}

A company has a $400 \times 400$ warehouse floor divided into unit square bays.
Rectangular pallets are placed on the floor, with sides parallel to the grid lines, and no two pallets overlap.

For ventilation reasons, \emph{in each row and in each column, exactly one unit square must be left empty}.

What is the \emph{minimum number of pallets} needed?

\section*{Solution (Extremal Argument using Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres)}

Because there is exactly one empty square in each row and in each column, the empty squares define a permutation of the set $\{1,2,\dots,400\}$.

Let $a$ be the length of the longest increasing subsequence and $b$ the length of the longest decreasing subsequence of this permutation. By the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres theorem,
\[
ab \ge 400,
\]
which implies
\[
a + b \ge 2\sqrt{400} = 40.
\]

Using a standard extremal labeling argument, one can mark at least
\[
400 + a + b - 3
\]
unit squares such that no axis-aligned rectangle can cover more than one marked square.
Therefore, each pallet can cover at most one marked square, and the number of pallets is at least
\[
400 + 40 - 3 = 437.
\]

Hence, any valid configuration requires at least $437$ pallets.

\section*{Answer}

\[
\boxed{437}
\]
